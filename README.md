# Travel Translator

**<u>Synopsis</u>**

For this project I've created a text translator app using Scratch's extension blocks. This app can be used to translate any text into dozens of different languages.

**<u>How it works</u>**

To use this app, users first need to select a language they want to translate the text into. The program then prompts the computer to type in the phrase to be translated. Once the user enters a phrase, the app displays the translated text in the chosen language on the screen.
